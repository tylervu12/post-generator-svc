"Best deliverability tip I could give: 

Focus on the fundamentals you know you need to have in place, then focus on the smaller things that may move the needle a bit.

Perfect example:If you're just starting out or haven't been sending for a while, make sure you have:

- Clean, diversified infra (Hypertide, Mailreef, non-branded domains)

- Short copy that you constantly vary

- No links, spam words, etc

All the basic deliverability fundamentals...Once you have those in place, you can focus on the smaller needle-movers.

Pretty much anything to do with the Smartlead API tbh.

- Changing warm-up tag keywords
- Rotating campaign start/end times

That type of thing.

Don't over-index on those before figuring out fundamentals.",twitter,5/30/2025

"Lead scoring with Clay guide:

> Use Claygent to grab general info on company (this prompt should be long and give you a detailed output - this matters for the next step)

> next prompt: Based off this input, on a scale of 1 to 5, 5 being the most accurate, 1 being the least accurate, does it match [detailed ICP description]? Give a score.

NOTES:

- Initial prompt must be long and detailed enough to grab all relevant info on company. This will determine the accuracy of the scoring from the next prompt. 

- Your ICP description in the second prompt must also be incredibly detailed. The clearer you are on it, the better the scoring goes.

"How our onboarding happens, step-by-step:

1. Client signs and pays quote.

2. Signature triggers an automated email that gives them the onboarding form and a guide on how to complete the onboarding form. 

3. The second they click submit on the form, an automation in our backend is kicked off, a part of which is a round robin to assign a CSM.

4. Customer gets an automated introduction email to their CSM with the CSM's calendar link for the customer to schedule an onboarding call.

5. With that, an onboarding document is automatically created that takes all of their form answers and puts it into a Google Doc with a little bit more info. 

6. Access for the customer is automatically created in Smartlead's white label.

7. Tasks are auto-assigned to everyone on the fulfillment team to complete the work required for the new client. 

After that, we go to the onboarding call where the CSM takes over the engagement.

"I've grown my agency from zero to multi 7-figures in under 5 years.

The biggest thing I learned about scaling a service business is you must assume your customers have zero knowledge of your process or how it works at all times

It's easy to get customers from organic content who know, like, and trust you. These clients will often be way easier to deal with, won't have as many questions, and be far less skeptical about you and your process.

But that changes with cold traffic (which you need to scale). 

You simply cannot assume that cold traffic knows likes and trusts you the way clients that come from organic traffic do. 

They are more skeptical, have way more questions, and of course will be harder to deal with. 

That's fine, but you need to do everything you can to get over the lack of inherent trust they have in you and deliver a great service. 

That means you must make your processes, documents, and communications as simple and detailed as possible. A monkey should be able to understand them. 

A few ways this shows up in your service:

1) Rock solid MSA and SOW with clear expectations and deliverables laid out. 

2) Crystal clear onboarding where you reiterate all expectations and deliverables and make the client verbally confirm that they understand all of them 

3) In-depth documentation as to what they can expect and/or use with your service (accessing billing, reports, etc.)

This may sound like overkill, but if you want any chance of scaling your service business, it is 100% necessary.",twitter,6/13/2025
